As part of the online course Python Basics & Beyond, offered by the Graph Course, 
here we had to work with a CO2 emission dataset, from Gapminder,and produce a report 
with three tabs: a data table, a line chart, and a choropleth map. Then, we had to
deploy it to GitHub. 

It was a very fun learning experience.
